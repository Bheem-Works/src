        <p>Is making game, Is Different from making the online website? </p>
        <p>I think i am really and stupid person who is doing nothings. Just feels laziness. I don't have focus on what i am making. 
        and i have never make game and the thing's that i have done with my self. i was relly on the toutorial youtubes videos and i just got stuck 
        and what ever youtubes teach me i just did that. I just need to build something's what'st comes in my mind small thing's but i have to 
        build that thing's with myself. No other's youtubes toturials ai help. Just me who is going to bild. And i want to be confident about it. 
        well making the games and doing the all stuff projects. Will that help me to become a good programmer or coder? and can i be able to solve the
      leetcode problems. Like if it is then i am going to tyr and i will make stuff with my own self. </p>
      </div>
      <div className="ownGame">Whenever i ask people to help he just told me you have to do that thing's in your way. You just need to read other's
      document and other's stuff. You have to gain the knowledge and try and practise for makin the games and whatever i wanted they actually don't help 
    like the ai just help be by giving the answers. So it's kind of thing's also.</div>
