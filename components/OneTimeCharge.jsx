            <p>Well what i mean when i talk about the one time charger plan. So, What this <strong>means?</strong>
                This means the mobile phone could be charge at the one single time.Thinks what if this can be happen. 
                It is possible though to make like this. and it would be a great thing's if this could be happen. 
            Don't you know people get about this idea? Well they do have and they got this kind of idea. 
              But why are not they are creating this kind of thing's. Doesn't this idea come to the elon musk mind ? 
              <strong>hahah</strong>
            Why scientist are not acting this idea? No context and quesitons about it. I was just curious about this type of stuff. 
              What is going to be happend if something's happens like that. And we could do like that. Why we don't have the one 
              time charger phone yett...?
            Is there any reason for not creating this <b>one??</b>
            Does it seems use less ? I know there could be the couples of the issues. Or many issue i am not a proffesor or 
            the science 
            students. I am just a curious students. I just wanted to know that's it. I want if something's help and 
            save the people time a lot.
